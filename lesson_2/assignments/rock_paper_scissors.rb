# takes the first letter (initial) of each string element
# of the array and saves it in a new array. If the first letter of the
# next element is already present in the new array, the
# iteration captures the first and second letter together.
# While the iteration do this, the method also
# associates with each initial/s, a second element
# which is the string 'for' and a third element
# which is the whole string that the iteration took the initial from.
# So, it creates an array of subarray formed by three elements each.
# And then it prints them out.
